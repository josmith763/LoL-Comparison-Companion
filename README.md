Welcome to my project, the League Comparison Companion. It provides statistics for you and the option to compare your stats with another persons.

The easiest way to access this would be through https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ddd647/League-of-Legends-Comparison-Companion/1.0.0. Also, I added you as a collaborator so you can view, comment, and make changes if you wish. 

Accessing /lol requests
- You need to have a Riot account, and get a personal API key (they expire every 24 hours but they are easy to regenerate) at https://developer.riotgames.com/docs/lol. Once you enter the API key into the form, you should be able to access the /lol requests

Accessing /survey requests
- This requires a basic authorization, and since it isnt able to be set up on OAS, it doesnt matter if you authorize or not, the results will be the same. Since this is a mocking server, most of the functionality isnt present but the algorithms are still there.

Regarding Status Codes
- As you can see, I went a little overboard with Status Code variables, and that is becasue I might expand some features later on, and would rather have the foundation for it already laid out. If you don't think I should do this, let me know!

If you have any questions, just email me or message me through Slack!
